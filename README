This is a simple demonstation of using a database with Perl. It was written
for a tutorial on Modern Perl in Linux Format issue 151.

* book.sql - SQL to create the ncessary database tables and user
* Book.pm  - Main database communication module
* Book/    - Directory containing other database communication modules
* book     - The command line program itself

The database communication modules were generated automatically using this
command:

  $ dbicdump -o components='["InflateColumn::DateTime"]' \
    Book dbi:mysql:database=books books README

The 'book' command is used as follows:

  $ book [list]
    - Shows all books currently in the database

  $ book add <ISBN>
    - Adds the given book to the system

  $ book start <ISBN>
    - Tells the system that you have started reading the given book

  $ book end <ISBN>
    - Tells the system that you have finished reading the given book
